    "description": "MalwareBazaar collects known malicious malware sample, enriches them with additional intelligence and provides them back to the community - for free!\n\nHere are just some of the features of MalwareBazaar:\n\n- Completely community driven and 100% free for commercial and non-commercial usage\n- Vetted malware samples only. No benign files. No Adware/PUP/PUA\n- Search for samples by malware family name, fuzzy hashing (like TLSH, imphash, etc) and tags\n\nAs many IT-security researchers, I'm heavily using public available information (OSINT) for hunting down new cyber threats. OSINT is a great resource for this threat intelligence! However, I often get confronted with a simple but severe problem: malware samples referenced in blog posts, whitepaper or mentioned on social media like Twitter are usually not easily available. You need to register on gazillion different online anti-virus scanning engines, sandboxes or malware databases in order to finally obtain the malware sample you need for your analysis.",
